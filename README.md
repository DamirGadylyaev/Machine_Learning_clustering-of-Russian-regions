# Unsupervised-Machine-Learning-clustering-of-Russian-regions
This project was created as a final project during my master's studying at Potsdam University for the subject of "Spatial data analysis with numerical methods".
Overall, four ML clustering algorithms have been used: Gaussian Mixture, K-means, Spectral CLustering, Ward Tree.
Bund2.csv - dataset that contains 11 features for 85 regions of Russia. Each feature is described in Dataset info (rus).docx. It's in Russian but will be translated by demand.
