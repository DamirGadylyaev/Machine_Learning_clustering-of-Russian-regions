# Unsupervised-Machine-Learning-clustering-of-Russian-regions
This project was created as a final project for the subject of "Spatial data analysis with numerical methods" during my master's studying at Potsdam University.

Overall, four ML clustering algorithms have been used: Gaussian Mixture, K-means, Spectral CLustering, Ward Tree.

BUND2.csv is a dataset that contains 11 features for 85 regions of Russia. Each feature is described in "Dataset info (rus).docx". It's in Russian but may be translated by demand.
